### Overall Evaluation

**1. Working environment**
The working environment is very friendly and open. FCJ members are always ready to support me when I have difficulties, even outside of working hours. The working space is neat and comfortable, helping me concentrate better. However, I think we can add some more exchange sessions or team bonding sessions so that everyone can understand each other better.

**2. Mentor / admin team support**
The mentor guides very detailedly, explains clearly when I do not understand and always encourages me to ask questions. The admin team supports procedures, documents and creates favorable conditions for me to work. I appreciate that the mentor allows me to try and solve problems myself instead of just giving answers.

**3. Matching work and major**
The work I am assigned is suitable for the knowledge I have learned at school, at the same time expanding new areas that I have never been exposed to. Thanks to that, I not only consolidated my basic knowledge but also learned practical skills.

**4. Opportunity to learn & develop skills**
During the internship, I learned many new skills such as using project management tools, teamwork skills, and professional communication in a corporate environment. The mentor also shared many practical experiences to help me better orient my career.

**5. Culture & Team Spirit**
The company culture is very positive: everyone respects each other, works seriously but still has fun. When there is an urgent project, everyone tries together, supports regardless of position. This helps me feel like I am part of the team, even though I am just an intern.

**6. Internship policies / benefits**
The company has and creates conditions for flexible time when needed. In addition, being able to participate in internal training sessions is a big plus.

### Other things
- What I was most satisfied with during my internship was the dedicated support of the mentor/admin team, always there to answer questions when members needed support
- If I recommend it to my friends, I would advise them to intern here because
  + There is a highly qualified admin team
  + Opportunity to learn new skills on AWS
  + Increase teamwork ability, communication ability in a corporate environment
