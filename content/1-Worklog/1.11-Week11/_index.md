### Week 11 Objectives:

* Complete the entire architecture and fully deploy the end-to-end application (frontend, backend, database, domain).
* Build a standard network infrastructure on VPC and ensure the system runs stably with load balancing, scaling, monitoring.
* Comprehensive testing to evaluate the stability, scalability and error handling ability of the system.

### Week 11 Achievements:

* Complete end-to-end system deployment: frontend on S3/CloudFront, backend on EC2 or Lambda, database using RDS.

* Set up standard VPC network infrastructure including subnet, route table, security group and ensure secure connection between components.

* Test and evaluate the system: load balancing, auto scaling, monitoring, logging — ensure the application operates stably and is scalable.
