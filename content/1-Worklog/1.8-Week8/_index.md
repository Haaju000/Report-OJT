### Week 8 Objectives:

* Understand and operate AWS Lambda: runtime mechanism, handlers, timeouts and event triggers (especially S3).
* Build and deploy API Gateway to connect Lambda, create basic REST API.
* Set up IAM Role and CloudWatch Logs to ensure Lambda operates securely, with full tracking and monitoring.

### Tasks to be carried out this week:
