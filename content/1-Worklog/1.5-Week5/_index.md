### Week 5 Objectives:

* Understand and deploy RDS (create database, configure parameter/option group, connect from EC2, set up Backup – Multi-AZ – Read Replica).
* Use DynamoDB, understand table structure (partition key, sort key) and create sample tables.
* Build an EC2 application that connects to RDS, has automatic backup and integrates an additional DynamoDB table to store test data.

### Tasks to be carried out this week:
