### Results achieved in week 4:

* Understand the basic network architecture of AWS: VPC, subnet, CIDR, route table, IGW, NAT, Security Group and NACL.

* Self-deploy a complete network system including VPC, public subnet with public EC2 and private subnet with private EC2.

* Configure the network path correctly and prove that EC2 private can access the Internet through NAT Gateway.
