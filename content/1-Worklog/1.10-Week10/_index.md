### Week 10 Objectives:

* Master the CI/CD process: from source code management with Git/GitHub to automated build & deploy with CodeBuild and CodePipeline.
* Set up a complete automated pipeline: push code → build → deploy to S3 or Lambda automatically.
* Practice real deployment: complete the weekly lab with a pipeline running smoothly from start to finish.

### Tasks to be carried out this week:
| Day | Task                                                                                                                                                                                                   | Start Date | Completion Date | Reference Material                        |
