### Week 6 Objectives:

* Master how to monitor AWS systems using CloudWatch Metrics, Logs, Alarms and SNS to detect errors and abnormal performance early.
* Understand and use CloudTrail to track and record all IAM activities for security and auditing.
* Practice implementing a complete monitoring & auditing system (create alarms, send notifications, enable CloudTrail for the entire region).
